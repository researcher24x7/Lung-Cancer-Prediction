1. Project Title: Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

2. Description
The lungs play a crucial role in respiration by supplying oxygen to every cell in the body while simultaneously filtering out harmful substances and pathogens. To protect the lungs, the human body is equipped with a specialized defense system. However, this natural protection is often insufficient to prevent various lung-related diseases. Conditions such as infections, inflammation, and severe complications, including the development of cancerous tumors, can significantly impact lung health. This study examines the use of machine learning in building predictive models that can identify individuals susceptible to lung cancer. The goal is to enable early detection and intervention, minimizing long-term health consequences. Among the machine learning approaches examined, Gradient Boosting demonstrated superior performance. The effectiveness of the model is measured using well-known evaluation criteria, including precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy. Results from experiments demonstrated that the proposed model achieved a top accuracy of 98.2%, outperforming the majority of other models.
